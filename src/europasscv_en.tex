  \ecvblueitem[1pt]{Course}{Control of Robots}
  \ecvitem{}{
    Implementation of a hybrid position/force controller for a lightweight manipulator
    equipped with a hand-like end-effector.The hybrid approach was used to exploit
    hand-environment interactions, which are required to perform the grasp of thin objects,
    in a safe way.
    \par
    The controller was developed using ROS (C++), simulated in Gazebo and tested
    on a real manipulator. The system was provided with an operator GUI developed in Qt.

  \ecvblueitem[1pt]{Course}{Identification and Control of Uncertain Systems}
  \ecvitem{}{
    Development of several control systems that regulate the position
    of the second mass in response to a step input in presence of load disturbance,
    measurement noise and parametric uncertainties.
    \par
    Several control techniques were used such as LQG/LTR, $\mathcal H_{\infty}$ and $\mu$  synthesis.
    \par
    Stability and performance robustness were tested using Matlab Robust Control Toolbox and
    simulation was performed using Simulink.

  \ecvblueitem[1pt]{Course}{Real Time Systems}
  \ecvitem{}{
    Real time simulation of several flying 2D quadrotors each equipped
    with a LQG control system. The trajectory of each vehicle can be random or
    specified by the user.
    \par
    The software was written in C using the Pthreads library.
    The GUI was developed using the game programming library Allegro 4.

  \ecvitem{}{
    Development of a distributed system composed of three
    wheeled robots that move a box to a given position cooperatively in a
    space without constraints.
    \par
    Key concepts explored in the project are: point to point control of the robots, planning and obstacle
    avoidance, online distributed estimation of the position of the box.
    \par
    The system was developed using ROS (Python) and simulated in Gazebo.

  \ecvitem{}{
    Implementation of the firmware for a WiFi enabled MCU that
    acquires the signals from three encoders, representing
    the attitude of a mechanical system, and send them via UDP.
    \par
    The system was provided with several tools: a web server, developed as a part
    of the firmware, for the configuration and a standalone
    GUI developed in Python to represent the attitude of the system.
    \par
    Firmware programming was done in C using the Broadcom WICED SDK.
