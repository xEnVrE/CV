\section{\textbf{Who I am}}
I am a third year \emph{PhD student} in \emph{humanoid robotics} with a background in \emph{automation} and \emph{robotics engineering}.
\par
My main research topic deals with \emph{multi-modal object perception} and \emph{manipulation}. Currently, my focus is on the development of \emph{6D object pose tracking} algorithms for humanoid robots that combine neural networks and Bayesian filtering.
\par
Although the 6D object pose tracking problem has been extensively addressed in the Computer Vision, Deep learning and Filtering literature, I strongly fell that there are still many open problems dealing with the application of such algorithms to humanoid robots having limited proprioception and perception capabilities.
\par
I really look forward to being active part of the research community with my contribution to the solution of these fascinating and challenging problems.
